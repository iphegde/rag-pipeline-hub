# RAG Pipeline Hub

Welcome to **RAG Pipeline Hub**, a comprehensive repository for building, exploring, and optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This repository combines information retrieval with large-scale generative models to create smarter, more efficient content generation pipelines.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

RAG is a powerful architecture that enhances the output of generative models by retrieving relevant information from large databases or documents before generating content. By combining retrieval-based search with natural language generation, RAG improves the accuracy and relevance of responses in applications like question-answering, summarization, and content generation.

## Features

- **End-to-End RAG Pipelines**: Pre-built and customizable pipelines integrating information retrieval systems and generative models.
- **Sample Projects**: Example projects demonstrating how to implement RAG for different use cases such as Q&A systems, document summarization, and chatbot integrations.
- **Retrieval Techniques**: Implementations of various retrieval methods including dense, sparse, and hybrid retrieval for improving the quality of retrieved content.
- **Optimized Generative Models**: Pre-trained large language models fine-tuned for RAG-based tasks, providing enhanced knowledge-grounded generation.
- **Tutorials & Documentation**: Step-by-step guides to help developers get started with RAG workflows, covering both the retrieval and generation components.
